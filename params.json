A typical EEG apparatus \r\nmight record 128 channels at 512 Hz resulting in about 4 million data \r\npoints per minute. While normal EEG signals tend to vary on a scale of \r\napproximately 100 microvolts, a loose connector can result in voltages in the \r\ntens of thousands of microvolts. \r\n\r\nEEGVIS uses a flexible drill-down strategy to summarize the data and to \r\nall users to examine more closely areas of interest.  See [EEGVIS Project Page](http://visual.cs.utsa.edu/eegvis) for more details.\r\n\r\nThe EEGVIS design is described in:\r\nEEGVIS: a MATLAB toolbox for browsing, exploring, and viewing large datasets\r\nby Kay A.
